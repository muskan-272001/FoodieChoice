**Foodie Choice Website**

About the Project
Foodie Choice is a web application that allows users to make restaurant reservations easily. The application is designed to provide a seamless experience for users to explore available time slots, choose their preferred date and time, and book a table at their favorite restaurant.

**Key Features**

**User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface built with React.js for a smooth user experience.

**Reservation System:** Users can view available time slots and make reservations based on their preferences.

**Backend API:** The backend is built using Express.js, which handles all the data processing and communication with the database.

**Database Integration:** Reservations and other related data are stored securely in a database, ensuring that all bookings are recorded and managed efficiently.

**Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Technologies Used**

**Frontend:**

**React.js:** For building the user interface.
**CSS/Styled Components:** For styling the components and layout.

**Backend:**

**Express.js:** For handling API requests and business logic.
**Node.js:** As the runtime environment for the backend.
**MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL (or your preferred database):** For storing reservation data.

**Project Structure**

The project is structured into two main directories:

**Frontend:** Contains all the React components, pages, and assets for the user interface.
**Backend:** Includes the Express.js server, routes, models, and database connection logic.

**How It Works**
User Interaction: Users interact with the frontend, browsing available times and selecting their desired reservation slot.
API Requests: The frontend sends API requests to the backend to retrieve available slots and submit reservation data.
Database Operations: The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database to check availability, and stores the reservation information.
Confirmation: Once the reservation is successfully made, the user receives a confirmation message.

**Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
